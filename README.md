# Basic Machine Learning in R (side project)



# Introduction
This repository displays a basic machine learning project within the R programming language. This project gave me some insights on machine learning and predictive models.  Let's read more about the project's abstract.



# Abstract
Fitting a model is when you use the input data to create a predictive model. There are various metrics you can use to determine how well your model fits the data. 

I learned how to create statistical models using linear regression. linear regression is one of many machine learning algorithms. Machine learning algorithms use statistics to teach computers how to perform certain tasks by learning from data rather than being explicitly programmed to perform those tasks.



# Summary of Skills
I used the R programming language and the ggplot2, pandas, numpy and sklearn packages.

You can try this in R Studio.



# Findings
machine learning

An overly simplified view of machine learning.

Machine learning, while built upon statistical foundations, often uses slightly different terminology. Traditional statistics uses the term independent variables to describe the inputs to algorithms, while machine learning uses the terms predictors or features. Similarly, statistical applications use the term dependent variables to describe the outputs of algorithms, whereas machine learning uses responses to describe outputs.

Machine learning algorithms fall into one of two broad categories; supervised and unsupervised algorithms. Supervised algorithms use datasets with known inputs and outputs to train a machine learning model. Supervised algorithms are like teacher guiding student learning using homework assignments with known answers. Unsupervised algorithms look for patterns and structure in datasets without known outputs.



# Challenges
This project has many challenges that includes the plots of accuracy models that were related binary and trinary data. I had overcomed issues with ggplot2 and these datasets.



# Conclusion
This project is a mixture of unsupervised learning using the k-means clustering algorithm and supervised learning using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm.
