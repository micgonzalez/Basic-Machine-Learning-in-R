# Basic-Machine-Learning-in-R
Fitting a model is when you use the input data to create a predictive model. There are various metrics you can use to determine how well your model fits the data. I am using the R program to learn the basics of machine learning, from using python code, CSV files and the ggplot2, pandas, numpy and sklearn packages.

I learned how to create statistical models using linear regression. linear regression is one of many machine learning algorithms. Machine learning algorithms use statistics to teach computers how to perform certain tasks by learning from data rather than being explicitly programmed to perform those tasks.

An overly simplified view of machine learning.

Machine learning, while built upon statistical foundations, often uses slightly different terminology. Traditional statistics uses the term independent variables to describe the inputs to algorithms, while machine learning uses the terms predictors or features. Similarly, statistical applications use the term dependent variables to describe the outputs of algorithms, whereas machine learning uses responses to describe outputs.

Machine learning algorithms fall into one of two broad categories; supervised and unsupervised algorithms. Supervised algorithms use datasets with known inputs and outputs to train a machine learning model. Supervised algorithms are like teacher guiding student learning using homework assignments with known answers. Unsupervised algorithms look for patterns and structure in datasets without known outputs.

This repository is a mixture of unsupervised learning using the k-means clustering algorithm and supervised learning using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm.
